## Who we are... .

The group's main research objectives are to use evolutionary theory to approach human perception and behaviour, and to understand perception and behaviour within clinical settings. Current research activities include investigations into human movement, human mating behaviours and preferences, health and attractiveness, eating disorders, autism, and behaviour modification in healthcare settings.

By taking an evolutionary perspective, the Evolution, Perception and Behaviour Group unites researchers in a multidisciplinary approach to ask not only how, but why humans perceive and behave the way they do. In this attempt we draw ideas and expertise from cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, physiology, evolutionary biology, and animal behaviour.

We are interested in the following sorts of questions:

* To what extent are cognitive biases different in individuals with eating disorders?
* How do mate preferences change across the lifespan?
* Under what circumstances can odours influence behaviour?
* What is the role of anthropomorphism in hoarding behaviour?
* Which non-verbal cues align with dominance and aggression? 
* To which degree do individual differences determine social network size?

We are keen to support PhD research, and welcome enquiries from prospective doctoral students.
